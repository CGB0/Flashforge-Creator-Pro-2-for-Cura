# Flashforge-for-Cura

Just download the master zip and drop the files into your cura 3.6 install folder NOT THE APPDATA
This will add the flashforge printer to your cura add printer under the custom tab you have to install the GPX plugin to make it work


I am still working on the start and end gcode to make it work better!
